// I am going to create several classes - BlackAndWhiteFilter, NegativeFilter, FlipVerticalFilter, LaplacianFilter, GaussianFilter, and UnsharpMaskingFilter - Just like the examples
// Tried creating the EmbossFilter but I was unsuccessful. 
// I was stuck on the BlackAndWhiteFilter for a while, took me several days to figure it out. Searched YouTube for help, and it worked. 
// The negative filter also took me some time to figure out because I did not know how to properly format the codes.
// I was trying out some code for the BlackAndWhiteFilter when I stumbled upon making the filter just dimnmer everytime the user presses the filter button.
// And so I created the dimming filter.
// Tried some inputing other numbers and came across the thermal filter where it made the picture look like it was seen through thermal imaging.
// I wish I had more time to work on this project as it was very interesting, with more time I could've come up with more filters, but time is not on my side.
// Coding in Java has made me appreciate libraries because I started with C++ in my previous school, and most of the time I had to brute force my way into making my projects work.
